# GeoWordle
A wordle inspired game that incorperates aspects of another game, geoguesser


Plan Of Action:
  - Find Database with pictures, google api is too expensive, worst case just make 20 screenshots for purpose of game and make own database
  - Configure game mechanics using combination of express, node, javascript... possibly react
  - Use CSS to make it look nice
  - pay google sites to buy a domain 
  - profit?
