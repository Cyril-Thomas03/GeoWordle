# GeoWordle
A wordle inspired game that incorperates aspects of another game, geoguesser


Plan Of Action:
  - Find Database with pictures, google api is too expensive, worst case just make 20 screenshots for purpose of game and make own database
  - Configure game mechanics using combination of express, node, javascript... possibly react
  - Use CSS to make it look nice
  - pay google sites to buy a domain 
  - profit?


Web Map (Paint is too hard):
- Configure database 
  - SQL maybe? or mongo? idk or something even simpler?

- Configure back end stuff 
  - recieve country from client and then send back whether the country is correct and if not, direction based on locations of correct country and inputed country

Configure front end stuff
  - display to user if answer is correct or not 
  - display direction of correct country
  - Cool animations?
 
 Communciations between server and clinet
  -just JSON probs
